                    <p>
	                Many optometrists use scare tactics, like misleading data and graphic images of eye infections, to insinuate that contact lenses are dangerous and should only be purchased from them and used under their close supervision.

						What does this misleading data have to do with prescription release? Nothing.

						What does this misleading data have to do with passive verification and the use of automated phone calls? Nothing.
					</p>
					<p>
						The use of misleading health claims serves only one purpose: to convince lawmakers to let optometrists continue to force consumers to buy directly from them. Without a copy of their prescription, it's much more difficult for a consumer to shop around and buy contacts from someone else.

						You’ll hear the term “keratitis” thrown around. Keratitis is an inflammation of the cornea. It’s associated with improper contact lens wear and isn’t as prevalent or as serious as some optometrists would like you to believe. In reality:
