                    <ul class="numbered">
	                    
                        <li>
                            
                            <span class="num-icon small">1</span>
                            
                            <p>
	                            You're legally required to have a contact lens prescription in order to 
	                            buy contact lenses. Traditionally, this requires going to an optometrist 
	                            once per year to have an exam (even if your eyes feel fine).
	                        </p>
	                        
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            
                            <span class="num-icon small">2</span>
                            
                            <p>
	                            Optometrists sell what they prescribe. In fact, 50-60% of their income comes 
	                            from the sale of contacts and glasses &mdash; not providing a medical service. 
	                            This income directly affects their revenue (positively) and your wallet (negatively).
	                        </p>
	                        
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            <span class="num-icon small">3</span>
                            
                            <p>
	                            Because of that conflict of interest, optometrists frequently refuse to give out 
	                            copies of contact lens prescriptions. Why? They don't want their customers patients 
	                            to take their prescription and shop around for a better price or buying experience.
	                        </p>
	                        
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                        
                            <span class="num-icon small">4</span>
                            
                            <p>
	                            Optometrists have a long history of refusing to release prescriptions to patients. 
	                            Lawsuits have happened and legislation has been passed requiring them to automatically 
	                            give patients their prescriptions. And still, many of them refuse. How bad is the 
	                            problem? Pretty bad:

                    </ul>
                    
                </div>

	                    A 2019 study showed 49% of contact lens wearers didn't automatically receive their 
	                    prescriptions. Worse, 21% of contact lens wearers never received a copy of their 
	                    prescription at all.
