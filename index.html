                    <h3>Why the Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act (FCLCA) exists</h3>
                    <p>Eye doctors make up to half of their income off selling the very thing they prescribe: contacts and glasses. This conflict of interest has led to some egregious behavior over the years from some eye doctors who want to limit their patients’ choice so they have buy contacts and glasses from them.</p>
                    <p>In 2004 the Fairness to Contact Lens Consumer Act was enacted which requires consumers to receive a copy of their prescription for free, without having to ask for it. Seems fair.</p>

                    <h3>Eye doctors continue to break the law</h3>
                    <p>Unfortunately, over the last 16 years eye doctors continue to withhold patients’ prescriptions, charge extra for them, or use scare tactics (“You have special eyes and the only place you can get your contacts is from me”) to preserve their margins at their customers’ expense. Literally.</p>

                    <h3>The Contact Lens Rule: protecting consumers and holding eye doctors accountable</h3>
                    <p>With many of the same issues still facing consumers that the FCLCA was supposed to protect against, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) unanimously approved the Contact Lens Rule which requires eye doctors to get and keep a signed acknowledgment that the patient received their prescription.</p>
                    <p>Many eye doctors don’t want to be held accountable to the law and are making excuses about why they shouldn’t be.</p>

                    <h3>Why Sen. Boozman introduced the CLR “Modernization” Act</h3>
                    <p>The American Optometric association and contact lens manufacturers lobbied Senator Boozman to introduce the Contact Lens Rule Modernization Act (as if a rule that was updated 3 months ago needs to be “modernized”).</p>

                    <h3>How much do you think it costs to sign a piece of paper?</h3>
                    <p>Some eye doctors claim that simple act of having their patients sign an acknowledgement – paper or digital – will cost them upwards of $18,000 per year.</p>
                    <p><strong>No, seriously. That’s really what they’re claiming.</strong></p>
                    <p>On the other hand, the FTC only thinks it’ll cost an eye doctor about $159 per year. (And you know if the FTC is estimating the cost of something it’s probably going to be even less than that.)</p>

                    <p>Some eye doctors are trotting out gross pictures, misleading information, and scare tactics about what can happen if contact lenses aren’t treated like weapons-grade plutonium. Does Senator Boozman really believe that getting a signed acknowledgment will give people corneal disease?</p>

                    <p>This same group of eye doctors also claim that using automated calls to verify their patients’ prescriptions aren’t useful/are hard to understand. We’ll let you be the judge (patient name redacted for privacy):</p>

                    <p>We’re pretty proud of the quality of our prescription verification calls. The call system uses a combination of state-of-the-art tech and our live customer service associates to make sure the correct doctor’s office was reached before the recording begins playing. Eye doctors get, on average, three of these calls per week.</p>

                    <h3>We’ve been down this road</h3>
                    <p>After the American Optometric Association was sued by 32 states attorneys general, and censured for X. Also, Bad Thing Y and Bad Thing Z. As a result, the Fairness to Contact Lens Consumer Act was passed. Still, they flout the law. Now the FTC has spent five years reviewing, accepting comments, and debating the Contact Lens Rule and come to the unanimous consensus that it’s in the best interest of consumers. Clearly the current attempts to leverage Congress to undermine the FTC’s dedicated efforts are the desperate last resort by the eye doctors who don’t want to be held accountable to the law at the literal expense of their patients.</p>
