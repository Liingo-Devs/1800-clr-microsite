                <h3>How (and why) human-initiated voice recordings work.</h3>
                
                <p>Optometrists have a bunch of made-up concerns about the effectiveness of automated calls for
                    prescription verifications. Of course, if all optometrists gave out prescriptions like they&rsquo;re
                    legally required to, we wouldn&rsquo;t have to call them for verifications in the first
                    place.</p>
                    
                <p>Automated verification calls are not the only automated calls being used in the healthcare
                    industry. Optometrists use automated calling systems to confirm appointments and pharmacies use
                    them to let you know when your medicine is ready to be picked up and no one has an issue with
                    it. How is this different than using similar systems to verify customer prescriptions as
                    required by federal law?</p>
                    
                <div class="card blue">

		                The Commission has stated that the Act expressly permits telephone communication for
						verification and believes that it would be contrary to congressional intent to prohibit the use
						of automated telephone calls for prescription verification.

                <p>
	                To address optometrist concerns with automated calling systems, the FTC implemented the following requirements for sellers:
                </p>
                
                <ul class="numbered">

	                    	1
	                    </span>
	                    <p>
	                    	Record the entire call.
	                    </p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                    	<span class="num-icon small">
	                    	2
	                    </span>
	                    <p>
	                    	Start the call by identifying that the call is a request for prescription verification.
	                    </p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                    	<span class="num-icon small">
	                    	3
	                    </span>
	                    <p>
	                    	Provide the content of the call in a slow and deliberate manner.
	                    </p>
                    </li>

	                    	4
	                    </span>
	                    <p>
	                    	Give the optometrist the option to repeat the information.
	                    </p>
                    </li>
                    
                </ol>
                
                <p>
	                These standards are required for all retailers. With the exception of recording calls, 
	                1-800 Contacts has already been meeting these requirements since 2004, plus providing extra
                    features to make it easier for optometrists such as pausing calls and scheduling a call back.
                </p>

	                Automated calling systems are the most ironclad method for verifying prescriptions

                <p>
	                1-800 Contacts has been verifying contact lens prescriptions for nearly 20 years and
                    during that time, we’ve learned a few lessons about verification:
