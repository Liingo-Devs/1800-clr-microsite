                <h3>The FTC has already established:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Patient safety concerns have been thoroughly considered.</li>
                    <li>Their five-year review was comprehensive.</li>
                    <li>Automated calls are an acceptable method for verification.</li>
                    <li>Signed Acknowledgment is a minor, reasonable cost with a large consumer benefit.</li>
                    <li>Posting signs won’t solve the problem of optometrists failing to release prescriptions, whereas Signed Acknowledgment will.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The FTC is well aware of the illegal actions many optometrists take to prevent consumers from receiving a copy of their prescription. Because of this, the FTC, in a bi-partisan result, unanimously added a “Signed Acknowledgment” requirement for optometrists.</p>
                <h5>Signed Acknowledgment = a simple, inexpensive way to ensure the FTC can enforce the requirement to automatically release contact lens prescriptions.</h5>
                <p>Signed Acknowledgment includes the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The patient signs a document, copy of a contact lens prescription, or sales receipt stating they received their prescription. The optometrist then keeps a copy.</li>
                    <li>If a digital copy of a prescription is provided to the patient, the optometrist must retain proof the prescription was sent, received, or made accessible, and is downloadable in a common format (such as .PDF), and printable.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The FTC appropriately realized that the only way to hold optometrists accountable to automatically release prescriptions was to introduce Signed Acknowledgment as a method for enforcement. They identified five reasons why this requirement is necessary:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Consumer surveys have repeatedly shown that optometrists are not complying with automatic prescription release and are not informing patients of their right to a copy of their prescription.</li>
                    <li>The FTC has received “numerous personal accounts of prescribers’ failure to release prescriptions.”</li>
                    <li>Sellers must verify orders because optometrists fail to release prescriptions. If optometrists would release prescriptions more often, the number of verification requests would go down.</li>
                    <li>Consumers are required to have a copy of their prescription to buy contact lenses. Since optometrists also sell contact lenses, they have an incentive to not release prescriptions to consumers.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><b>All of these reasons lead to one simple conclusion: Signed Acknowledgment is needed by the FTC in order to enforce automatic prescription release.</b></p>

                <h5>Signage vs. Signed Acknowledgment</h5>
                <p>Posting signs that inform customers of their right to their prescription is not the same as providing a copy to customers. Just because a doctor posts a sign in their office doesn’t actually ensure that they provide prescriptions to their patients. Requiring the patient to acknowledge that they received the prescription does.</p>
                <h5>The FTC agrees:</h5>
                <blockquote>“Far fewer consumers would learn of their rights from a sign than from being asked to sign a receipt; signage would serve as less of a reminder to prescribers and their staff to release prescriptions; signage would do nothing to aid the Commission in monitoring and enforcing the prescription-release requirement; and relying on patients to notice a sign and ask for their prescription puts the onus on consumers to enforce the Rule…”</blockquote>
