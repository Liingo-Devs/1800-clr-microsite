                <p>
	                The FTC is well aware of the illegal actions many optometrists take to prevent 
	                consumers from receiving a copy of their prescription. Because of this, the 
	                FTC, in a bi-partisan result, unanimously added a “Signed Acknowledgment” 
	                requirement for optometrists.
	            </p>
                
                <h4>
	                Signed Acknowledgment = a simple, inexpensive way to ensure the FTC 
	                can enforce the requirement to automatically release contact lens 
	                prescriptions.
	            </h4>
	            
                <p>
	                Signed Acknowledgment includes the following:
	            </p>
                
                <ul class="numbered no-num dark">
                    <li>
                    	<span class="num-icon"></span>
                    	<p>
	                    	The patient signs a document, copy of a contact lens prescription, 
	                    	or sales receipt stating they received their prescription. The 
	                    	optometrist then keeps a copy.
	                    </p>
	                </li>
                    <li>
                    	<span class="num-icon"></span>
                    	<p>
	                    	If a digital copy of a prescription is provided to the patient, the 
	                    	optometrist must retain proof the prescription was sent, received, 
	                    	or made accessible, and is downloadable in a common format (such as .PDF), 
	                    	and printable.
	                    </p>
	                </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The FTC appropriately realized that the only way to hold optometrists accountable to automatically release prescriptions was to introduce Signed Acknowledgment as a method for enforcement. They identified five reasons why this requirement is necessary:</p>
                
                <ul class="numbered">
                    
                    <li>
                    	
                    	<span class="num-icon small">
	                    	1
	                    </span>
                    	
                    	<p>
	                    	Consumer surveys have repeatedly shown that optometrists are not 
							complying with automatic prescription release and are not informing 
							patients of their right to a copy of their prescription.
						</p>
						
					</li>
					
                    <li>
                    	
                    	<span class="num-icon small">
	                    	2
	                    </span>
                    	
                    	<p>
	                    	The FTC has received “numerous personal accounts of prescribers’ 
							failure to release prescriptions.”
						</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                    	
                    	<span class="num-icon small">
	                    	3
	                    </span>
                    	
	                    <p>
		                    Sellers must verify orders because optometrists fail to release prescriptions. 
							If optometrists would release prescriptions more often, the number of verification 
							requests would go down.
	                    </p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                    	
                    	<span class="num-icon small">
	                    	4
	                    </span>
                    	
                    	<p>
	                    	Consumers are required to have a copy of their prescription to buy contact 
							lenses. Since optometrists also sell contact lenses, they have an incentive 
							to not release prescriptions to consumers.
                    	</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <div class="card blue">
	                <p>
		                All of these reasons lead to one simple conclusion: 
						Signed Acknowledgment is needed by the FTC in order 
						to enforce automatic prescription release.
					</p>
	            </div>

                <h4>Signage vs. Signed Acknowledgment</h4>
                
                <p>Posting signs that inform customers of their right to their prescription is not the same as providing a copy to customers. Just because a doctor posts a sign in their office doesn’t actually ensure that they provide prescriptions to their patients. Requiring the patient to acknowledge that they received the prescription does.</p>
                
                <h4>The FTC agrees:</h4>
                
                <div class="card white">
	                <p>
		                "Far fewer consumers would learn of their rights from a sign than 
		                from being asked to sign a receipt; signage would serve as less 
		                of a reminder to prescribers and their staff to release prescriptions; 
		                signage would do nothing to aid the Commission in monitoring and 
		                enforcing the prescription-release requirement; and relying on 
		                patients to notice a sign and ask for their prescription puts the 
		                onus on consumers to enforce the Rule..."
