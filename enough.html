                    <h3>The Contact Lens Rule (CLR) has already been thoroughly vetted by the FTC.</h3>
                    <p>The FTC first asked for comments on the CLR in 2015. Yes, they worked on this for half a decade. In that time:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The FTC had three different comment periods as well as a workshop in 2018.</li>
                        <li>Over 9,000 comments were submitted.</li>
                        <li>The FTC took holistic actions during this review period to address industry concerns with the CLR. As a result, it has adjusted requirements while trying to balance patient safety with consumer protection.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Enough is enough.</h3>
                    <p>The FTC commissioners, in a bi-partisan decision, unanimously accepted the final Contact Lens Rule, which became effective October 16, 2020. It's time to recognize the FTC's thorough review and conclusions regarding the CLR are in the best interest of contact lens wearers.</p>
